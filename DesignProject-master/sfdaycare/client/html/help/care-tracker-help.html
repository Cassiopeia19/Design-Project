                Here you are able to view the logged dates
                and times. If you'd like to make a change to a record, <strong>navigate back to the Check-In/Out page</strong> and make your changes by selecting
                the date you'd like to change, and input the correct times. The system will tell you that a record already exists and will ask you if you'd like to
                overwrite the record.
