        <h2>The system divides each child into either the "Active Children, or "Inactive Children" listing</h2>
        <h4>This is determined by whether you have selected the status of the child as either "Active" or "Inactive".
            You may switch the status of a child at any time, within the "View/Edit" child module which can be reached by 
            clicking on the "View/Edit" button.
        </h4>
