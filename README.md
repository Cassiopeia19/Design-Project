# Design-Project

In this group of seven project, there were five of us in charge of the coding.  My tasks:  I had taken someone else's design of the website pages and expanded upon this.  I also assisted our client in:  choosing a color scheme for her public-facing side of her web-based app, creating a business logo (of which I had photo-shopped for her web pages), creating a banner (this appears on the home page), providing the code for the slideshow, incorporating our client's Google calendar, and creating a Google form, with validations, for her contact page.  I also provided code for the check-in/check-out (**see timekeeper repository**), but my group declined to use this code.  I was not able to get the webpages to be "responsive", as the normal code that would work on most apps did not work within the Meteor environment.  Additionally, I had set up the login that allows the client to login via her Google login.
